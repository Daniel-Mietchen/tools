   - Collaboration/sharing between groups.
   - accepts multiple workflow technologies.
   - ~~Open/execute workflow directly on the web via [OnlineHPC](http://onlinehpc.com/)([w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlineHPC))~~ (offline since May 2016).
cons:
   - workflows are quite repetitive as they are not like functions - but that's workflow problem, not myExperiment itself.

myExperiment offers a *social network* for multiple workflow tools like
[Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyExperiment)([w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna)),
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org),
[Kepler](https://kepler-project.org/), ...

For now, e-infrastructures as [er-flow](http://www.erflow.eu/) or
[shiwa](http://www.shiwa-workflow.eu/) builds on
workflows so researchers can run some of them.

myExperiment offers a *social network* for multiple workflow tools like
[Taverna][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyExperiment]([w][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna]),
[Galaxy][https://galaxyproject.org],
[Kepler][https://kepler-project.org/], ...

For now, e-infrastructures as [er-flow][http://www.erflow.eu/] or
[shiwa][http://www.shiwa-workflow.eu/] builds on
workflows so researchers can run some of them.
